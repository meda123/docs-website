## Email notifications 

Want to be in the know when an error group has been assigned to you? We got you! When an error group is assigned to a user, the user immediately receives an email with the error group’s details*.

Email notifications are triggered when: 

  * An error group is assigned and unassigned to a user.
  * The state of an error group has changed. The user assigned to the error group will be notified.
