metaDescription: Meraki API polling is working, but expected metrics are missing.

## Problem [#problem]

During Meraki API monitoring, you don't see all of the expected metrics for your controller.

## Solutions [#solutions]

Identify what metrics exist in New Relic by running the following NRQL query:

```sql
FROM Metric, KExtEvent SELECT
count(*)
FACET metricName OR eventType()
WHERE instrumentation.name LIKE 'meraki%'
OR eventType() = 'KExtEvent'
SINCE 1 HOUR AGO LIMIT MAX
```

This query will give you a list of every dimensional metric and event being collected from your Meraki controller in the last hour. The sections below map each metric and event to its relative visualization in the Meraki controller entity dashboard.

### Meraki API metrics [#meraki-metrics]

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="client-metrics"
    title="Client Metrics"
  >
    ```
    kentik.meraki.clients.Recv
    kentik.meraki.clients.RecvTotal
    kentik.meraki.clients.Sent
    kentik.meraki.clients.SentTotal
    ```

    These metrics map to these widgets:
      * Summary
      * Connected Clients
      * Top 10 - Clients by Recv Bytes
      * Top 10 - Clients by Sent Bytes
      * Top 10 - Applications by Recv Bytes
      * Top 10 - Applications by Sent Bytes
      * Device Inventory
      * Client Summary

    Collection of these metrics is dictated by the `meraki_config.monitor_devices: true` setting in the [Meraki Dashboard API](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/network-performance-monitoring/advanced/advanced-config/#meraki-dashboard-api) settings of your configuration file.

    If the value of this setting is already set to `true` and you are still missing data, check your container logs for API failures and the next step would be to open a support ticket for assistance.

  <Collapser
    id="uplink-metrics"
    title="Uplink Metrics"
  >
    ```
    kentik.meraki.uplinks.LatencyMS
    kentik.meraki.uplinks.LossPct
    kentik.meraki.uplinks.Recv
    kentik.meraki.uplinks.Sent
    ```

    These metrics map to the **WAN Health** table.

    Collection of these metrics is dictated by the `meraki_config.monitor_uplinks: true` setting in the [Meraki Dashboard API](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/network-performance-monitoring/advanced/advanced-config/#meraki-dashboard-api) settings of your configuration file.

    If the value of this setting is already set to `true` and you are still missing data, check your container logs for API failures and the next step would be to open a support ticket for assistance.

  <Collapser
    id="config-change-events"
    title="Config Change Events"
  >
    ```
    KExtEvent
    ```

    This event maps to the **Meraki Configuration Changes** table.

    Collection of these metrics is dictated by the `meraki_config.monitor_devices: true` setting in the [Meraki Dashboard API](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/network-performance-monitoring/advanced/advanced-config/#meraki-dashboard-api) settings of your configuration file.

    Note that this event can be very "quiet" and will only generate data when there are organization-level change events in the Meraki API endpoint for [getOrganizationConfigurationChanges](https://developer.cisco.com/meraki/api-latest/#!get-organization-configuration-changes). 

    If the value of this setting is already set to `true` and you are still missing data, check your container logs for API failures and the next step would be to open a support ticket for assistance.
