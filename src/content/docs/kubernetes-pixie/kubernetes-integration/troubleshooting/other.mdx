## Known issues

### Problem 

You have completed the [installation procedure](/docs/kubernetes-monitoring-integration#install) for New Relic's Kubernetes integration with helm for the `nri-bundle`, but the values in your `values.yaml` file are not being respected.

### Solution

Some [global values](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/tree/master/charts/nri-bundle#values) have been found to not be respected by our helm templates, so if you find that a global value isn't being respected by the appropriate chart, directly specify the chart. This workaround should fix the issue. 

```{yaml}
global: 
  licenseKey: <set_elsewhere>
  cluster: <set_elsewhere>
  tolerations: # We are interested in setting this toleration for our pods, but the global value is not respected for some reason 
    - key: role
      operator: Exists
      effect: NoSchedul

# Directly specifying the chart and the desired pod toleration will always be respected
newrelic-infrastructure: 
   kubelet: 
     tolerations: 
       - key: role
         operator: Exists
         effect: NoSchedule 
```
