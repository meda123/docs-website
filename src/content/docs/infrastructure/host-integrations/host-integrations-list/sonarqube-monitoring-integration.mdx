Our SonarQube integration monitors the performance of your SonarQube application, helping you diagnose and optimize the code. Our SonarQube integration makes use of our infrastructure monitoring agent and NRI-Prometheus, and gives you a pre-built dashboard with your most important SonarQube metrics.

## Install the infrastructure agent [#infra-install]

You can install the infrastructure agent two different ways: 

* Our [guided install](https://one.newrelic.com/nr1-core?state=4f81feab-35f7-e97e-9903-52510f8542bd) is a CLI tool that inspects your system and installs the infrastructure agent alongside the application monitoring agent that best works for your system. To learn more about how our guided install works, check out our [Guided install overview](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/installation/new-relic-guided-install-overview). 
* If you'd rather install our infrastructure agent manually, you can follow a tutorial for manual installation for [Linux](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/linux-installation/install-infrastructure-monitoring-agent-linux), [Windows](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/windows-installation/install-infrastructure-monitoring-agent-windows/), or [macOS](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/macos-installation/install-infrastructure-monitoring-agent-macos/). 

##  Install the PostgreSQL quickstart

1. Check out our PostgreSQL agent requirements in our [documentation](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/postgresql/postgresql-integration/)  before installing the agent.
2. Open the [PostgreSQL quickstart installation](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/postresql).
3. Click  **Install now** to start the Postgre quickstart installation.
4. Or you could execute the following command:

```bash
curl -Ls https://download.newrelic.com/install/newrelic-cli/scripts/install.sh | bash && sudo  NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID=ACCOUNT_ID /usr/local/bin/newrelic install -n postgres-open-source-integration
```


## Integrate SonarQube with New Relic [#integrate]

<CollapserGroup>
<Collapser
    id="step2"
    title="Configure NRI-Prometheus"
    >
1. Create a file named `nri-prometheus-config.yml` using this path: `/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/nri-prometheus-config.yml`
2. Use our [configuration template](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-prometheus/blob/main/configs/nri-prometheus-config.yml.sample) to update the created file named `nri-prometheus-config.yml`.
3. Avoid using the @ symbol in your password.
4. Update these fields:

   * cluster_name: `YOUR_DESIRED_CLUSTER_NAME`
   * urls: `[“http://user_name:password@YOUR_HOST_IP:9000/api/monitoring/metrics”]`
   * Insecure_skip_verify: `true`

Your `nri-prometheus-config.yml` file should look like this:

```yml
---
integrations:
  - name: nri-prometheus
    config:
      # When standalone is set to false nri-prometheus requires an infrastructure agent to work and send data. Defaults to true 
      standalone: false

      # When running with infrastructure agent emitters will have to include infra-sdk 
      emitters: infra-sdk

      # The name of your cluster. It's important to match other New Relic products to relate the data.
      cluster_name: "YOUR_DESIRED_CLUSTER_NAME"

      targets:
        - description: Sonarqube metrics list
          urls: ["http://user_name:password@YOUR_HOST_IP:9000/api/monitoring/metrics"]

      #     tls_config:
      #     ca_file_path: "/etc/etcd/etcd-client-ca.crt"
      #     cert_file_path: "/etc/etcd/etcd-client.crt"
      #      key_file_path: "/etc/etcd/etcd-client.key"

      # Whether the integration should run in verbose mode or not. Defaults to false
      verbose: false

      # Whether the integration should run in audit mode or not. Defaults to false.
      # Audit mode logs the uncompressed data sent to New Relic. Use this to log all data sent.
      # It does not include verbose mode. This can lead to a high log volume, use with care
      audit: false

      # The HTTP client timeout when fetching data from endpoints. Defaults to 30s.
      # scrape_timeout: "30s"

      # Length in time to distribute the scraping from the endpoints
      scrape_duration: "5s"

      # Number of worker threads used for scraping targets.
      # For large clusters with many (&gt;400) endpoints, slowly increase until scrape
      # time falls between the desired `scrape_duration`.
      # Increasing this value too much will result in huge memory consumption if too
      # many metrics are being scraped.
      # Default: 4
      # worker_threads: 4

      # Whether the integration should skip TLS verification or not. Defaults to false
      insecure_skip_verify: true

    timeout: 10s

    title="Forward SonarQube logs to New Relic"
>
You can use our [log forwarding](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/forward-logs/forward-your-logs-using-infrastructure-agent/) to forward SonarQube logs to New Relic.

On Linux machines, your log file named `logging.yml` should be present in this path:

```shell
/etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/
```

After creating the log file, add the following script to the `logging.yml` file:

```yml
logs:
  - name: sonar_logs
    file: /opt/sonarqube/logs/sonar.log
    attributes: 
      logtype: sonar_logs
``` 
</Collapser>
<Collapser
id="step4"
    title="Restart the New Relic infrastructure agent"
>

Restart your application. 

```shell
sudo systemctl restart newrelic-infra.service
```

In a couple of minutes, your application will send metrics to [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com).

## Find your data 

You can choose our pre-built dashboard template named `SonarQube` to monitor your SonarQube application metrics. Follow these steps to use our pre-built dashboard template:

1. From [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com), go to the **+ Add data** page. 
2. Click on **Dashboards**.
3. In the search bar, type `sonarqube`. 
4. The SonarQube dashboard should appear. Click on it to install it.

Your SonarQube dashboard is considered a custom dashboard and can be found in the **Dashboards** UI. For docs on using and editing dashboards, see [our dashboard docs](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards).

Here is a NRQL query to check your SonarQube web status:

```sql
SELECT latest(sonarqube_web_uptime_minutes) 
AS 'SonarQube Web Uptime (minutes)' 
FROM Metric
```
