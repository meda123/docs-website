New Relic CodeStream allows developers to see how the code they're responsible for is performing in production by bringing observability into the IDE and making it part of their daily routine. 

## Connect CodeStream and New Relic [#connect]

To access observability in your IDE you'll need to connect CodeStream to New Relic via your [New Relic user
API key](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/api-keys-ui.api-keys-launcher) (learn more about [New Relic user
API keys](/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#user-api-key)). 

<img
  title="Connecting CodeStream to New Relic with your New Relic user key."
  alt="A screenshot of connecting CodeStream to New Relic with your New Relic user key"
  src={codestreamConnectNewRelic}
/>

<figcaption>
  To bring observability into your IDE, connect CodeStream to New Relic with a user key.
</figcaption>

Once you have your user API key, click **Connect to New Relic** in the **Observability** section of CodeStream, then paste your user API key and click **Connect to New Relic**. If you signed up for CodeStream using your New Relic user API key then you'll already be connected.

To use the observability features in CodeStream, note that you must have a New Relic user type of [core user or full platform user](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type#user-type-capabilities).

## Associate repositories with New Relic entities [#repo-association]

The telemetry data available in CodeStream is contextual, meaning that it's all related to the code you have open in your IDE. To do this, CodeStream needs to know what entities in New Relic are built by the repositories you have open, and there are a number of ways to make these associations.

There are instances where CodeStream will prompt you to make an association if one doesn't exist. For example, if you try to view an error from New Relic in CodeStream, and the [entity](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/what-entity-new-relic) the error belongs to isn't associated with a repository, CodeStream will ask you to identify the appropriate repository. The Observability section of the the CodeStream pane will also prompt you to make an association for the currently selected repository in your IDE.

<img
  title="Associate repositories in your IDE with entities."
  alt="A screenshot of associating repositories in your IDE with entities."
  src={codestreamAssociateReposButton}
/>

In some cases your repository may need to be associated with multiple entities. For example, you might have different entities that represent different environments (like production, or staging) and they may all be associated with the same repository. To associate the current repository with an additional entity, click on **Add another service**. 

<img
  title="Associate an additional service with your repository."
  alt="A screenshot of associating an additional service with your repository."
  src={codestreamAssociateOtherServices}
/>

Making these associations on the fly when prompted is a great way to get started, but we recommend one of the following methods because they require less ongoing manual effort and eliminate the possibility of end-user mistakes, such as misconfigured remote URLs.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="env-var"
    title="Use environment variable with APM (recommended)"
  >
    Set the environment variable `NEW_RELIC_METADATA_REPOSITORY_URL`. New Relic <InlinePopover type="apm" /> agents create the repository entity and associate it with your application entity automatically.

    This requires the SSH or HTTPS remote URL format. We recommend that this be set as part of your build pipeline.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="repo-ui"
    title="Use the UI"
  >
    After you've started sending data to New Relic, use the UI to connect your related repository. Go to the APM summary page via **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > APM & Services > (select an app)**, then look for the **Repositories** section on the bottom-right.

    <img
      title="The connect repository button."
      alt="A screenshot of the connect repository button."
      src={codestreamConnectRepositories}
    />

    Click **Connect repository** to find an existing repository or add a new one.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="nerdgraph"
    title="Use the NerdGraph API"
  >
    Use New Relic's [NerdGraph APIs](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph/) to create a repository and associate it with your application entities.

    **Step 1: Create a repository entity**

    To create a repository entity, use the `referenceEntityCreateOrUpdateRepository` API and make sure to save the GUID that's produced. The API takes the following parameters:

    * `accountId` - the integer account ID for the account you want to add the repository to

    * `url` - example `https://github.com/newrelic/beta-docs-site.git`

    * `name` - example: `newrelic/beta-docs-site`

      ```
      mutation {
        referenceEntityCreateOrUpdateRepository(repositories: [{accountId: [YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID], name: "[REPO_NAME]", url: "[REPO_URL]"}]) {
          created
          failures {
            guid
            message
            type
          }
        }
      }
      ```

      To find the entity you create, you can use a query like the following. Note that the URL you provided to `referenceEntityCreateOrUpdateRepository` gets saved as an entity tag.

      ```
      {
        actor {
          entitySearch(query: "name = 'a name' OR tags.url = 'a url'") {
            count
            query
            results {
              entities {
                guid
                name
                tags {
                  key
                  values
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }

      ```

      **Step 2: Associate the repository entity to your application entity**

      First, find the GUID for the application you want to associate your repository to.

      Parameters:

    * `sourceEntityGuid` - the entity GUID of the application

    * `targetEntityGuid` - the entity GUID of your repository

    * `type` - always `BUILT_FROM`

      ```
      mutation {
        entityRelationshipUserDefinedCreateOrReplace(sourceEntityGuid: "", targetEntityGuid: "", type: BUILT_FROM) {
          errors {
            message
            type
          }
        }
      }
      ```

      To see all entities related to your repository you can do a query like this:

      ```
      {
        actor {
          entity(guid: "[YOUR_REPOSITORY_GUID]]") {
            relatedEntities(filter: {direction: BOTH, relationshipTypes: {include: BUILT_FROM}}) {
              results {
                target {
                  entity {
                    name
                    guid
                    type
                  }
                }
                type
              }
            }
            name
            type
            tags {
              values
              key
            }
          }
        }
      }
      ```

      **Step 3: Cleanup (if needed)**

      Delete a repository with the following query:

      ```
      mutation DeleteRepository {
        entityDelete(guids: "[ENTITY_GUID_HERE]]") {
          deletedEntities
          failures {
            message
            guid
          }
        }
      }
      ```
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

With any of these methods you can specify the remote URL in either the SSH or HTTPS format:

* `git@github.com:newrelic/beta-docs-site.git`
* `https://github.com/newrelic/beta-docs-site.git`

<Callout variant="caution">
  It's possible to add the same GitHub repository more than once, if you're using different protocols to do so. The UI warns you about this, but won't prevent you from doing so.

  For example, `https://github.com/tuna/repo` and `git@github.com:tuna/repo` are the same repo, with different protocols.
</Callout>

## Observability in the IDE [#observability-in-IDE]

The **Observability section** of CodeStream gives developers a view into how their code is performing by allowing them to see golden metrics and errors for each service associated with the repository currently selected in the IDE. Each service has its own node in the tree, and when expanded it shows the service's golden metrics, service level objectives, errors assigned to you, and the five most recent errors. You can also see the bigger picture by digging into the services that are called by or call your service, and see the golden metrics for each of them.

If the currently selected repository isn't associated with a service on New Relic you'll be prompted to make the association, or instrument the project.

<img
  title="The observability section shows golden metrics, errors assigned to you, and recent errors."
  alt="A screenshot of the observability section showing golden metrics, errors assigned to you, and recent errors."
  src={codestreamObservabilitySection}
/>

When hovering over a service name in the tree, click on the globe to open the service's summary page in New Relic. Click on any error to view the details, including the stack trace, and [start collaborating](#collaborate) on resolution.

<Callout variant="tip"> 
If your project isn't monitored by New Relic, you can set up monitoring by clicking on the gear icon in the heading of the **Observability section** and then selecting **Instrument my App**. CodeStream has setup wizards available for Node.js JS, Java, and .NET projects. 
</Callout>

## Code-level metrics [#code-level]

Code-level metrics give you detailed insight into how your code is performing at the method level. Metrics are displayed right in the editor above instrumented methods, allowing performance data to influence the work at hand. CodeStream will also identify poorly performing methods in your code, allowing you to proactively address performance issues as they arise.

### In-editor performance data [#clm-codelenses]

Without having to seek it out, performance data is displayed contextually in the editor so that it can inform the work at hand. Say you’re working on a bug fix, and happen to notice that the area of the code you’re working in has an elevated error rate. Maybe you address that issue as part of your bug fix so that it doesn’t escalate into a bigger problem.

<img
  title="A CodeLens displaying error rate and average duration for a method."
  alt="A screenshot CodeLens displaying error rate and average duration for a method."
  src={codestreamCodeLevelMetricsExample}
/>

CodeStream will show the average duration and error rate, for the last 30 minutes, in a CodeLens above each method instrumented by the New Relic APM agents. Metrics are calculated for the service currently selected in the **Observability** section of CodeStream. Expand a different service and the metrics will update accordingly.

Code-level metrics also help make code review more data driven, with CodeLenses being displayed in pull request diffs reviewed in CodeStream.

<img
  title="A pull request diff with code-level metrics."
  alt="A screenshot of a pull request diff with code-level metrics."
  src={codestreamCodeLevelDiffs}
/>

Click the CodeLens to see charts visualizing each of the metrics. If the repository is associated with multiple New Relic-monitored services, you can easily switch between them. This will change the service upon which the code-level metrics displayed in both the charts and the editor are based, and also change the service selection in the **Observability** section.

<img
  title="Code-level metrics details showing charts and errors."
  alt="A screenshot of code-level metrics details showing charts and errors."
  src={codestreamCodeLevelCharts}
/>

Along with a chart of the error rate you’ll also see a list of the actual errors happening in the same timeframe, including the number of occurrences for each. If the error rate is spiking, and you see one particular error is causing the problem, you can click on it to view the stack trace and [start collaborating](#collaborate) on resolution.

### Anomaly detection [#clm-anomalies]

CodeLenses are great for when you happen to be working in a section of the code exhibiting a performance problem, but performance issues are too important to just stumble upon! CodeStream will automatically call out poorly performing methods in your code in the **Observability > Code-Level Metrics** section.

<img
  title="Code-level metrics section showing poorly performing methods."
  alt="A screenshot of the code-level metrics section showing poorly performing methods."
  src={codestreamCodeLevelAnomalies}
/>

CodeStream identifies these methods by looking for anomalies in either error rate or average duration. If you’re using New Relic’s [change tracking](/docs/change-tracking/change-tracking-introduction/) to send deployment information, anomalies are calculated by comparing the performance since your last release against the preceding three weeks. Otherwise, we use the last seven days. You can control these timeframes, as well as the thresholds for determining whether or not a given method is performing poorly, by hovering over the **Code-Level Metrics** heading and clicking on the gear icon. 

In addition to the **Code-Level Metrics** section, CodeStream will also let you know about poorly performing methods via [desktop notifications](/docs/codestream/codestream-integrations/notifications#additionaldesktop) in either VS Code or JetBrains IDEs.

### Requirements [#clm-requirements]

In-editor CodeLenses are available for all of New Relic’s APM languages. Anomaly detection, however, is currently only available for Java, .NET, Python and Ruby.

To see metrics, your service must meet the requirements listed below, and the service should have collected data in the last 30 minutes. The New Relic agent attempts to automatically collect data for functions on classes that are tied to HTTP requests. In many cases, and with many frameworks that use an MVC framework, these are often methods on a Controller class. 

Because all requests by the New Relic agent are not collected all the time, it’s possible that low-traffic methods will not see any data. If data is missing for a specific method that you wish to see results for, you can use custom instrumentation to fill any gaps. See guidance for [Java](/docs/apm/agents/java-agent/custom-instrumentation/java-custom-instrumentation), [.NET](/docs/apm/agents/net-agent/custom-instrumentation/introduction-net-custom-instrumentation), [PHP](/docs/apm/agents/php-agent/features/php-custom-instrumentation), [Python](/docs/apm/agents/python-agent/custom-instrumentation/python-custom-instrumentation), [Ruby](/docs/apm/agents/ruby-agent/api-guides/ruby-custom-instrumentation), [Go](/docs/apm/agents/go-agent/instrumentation/instrument-go-transactions) and [Node.js](/docs/apm/agents/nodejs-agent/extend-your-instrumentation/nodejs-custom-instrumentation). Also note that for Node.js, code-level metrics are not captured for anonymous functions.

* [Distributed tracing](/docs/distributed-tracing/enable-configure/language-agents-enable-distributed-tracing) must be enabled. Distributed tracing is on by default in recent versions of all agents, so you only need to worry about this if you've disabled distributed tracing.
* **Go:** Requires Go agent version 3.19.2 or higher. Code-level metrics must also be [enabled in the Go agent configuration](/docs/apm/agents/go-agent/configuration/go-agent-code-level-metrics-config). If you're using VS Code, you must also have the [Go for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=golang.go) extension installed with the language server enabled.
* **Java:** Requires Java agent version 7.10.0 or higher. For version 7.11.0 or higher, code-level metrics are enabled by default. For version 7.10.0, code-level metrics must be manually [enabled in the Java agent configuration](/docs/apm/agents/java-agent/features/java-codestream-integration/). Code-level metrics are only available for projects implemented with a [supported Java framework](/docs/apm/agents/java-agent/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-java-agent/#frameworks). If you're using VS Code, you must also have the [Language Support for Java by Red Hat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.java) extension installed. Note that Kotlin support is only available in IntelliJ.
* **.NET:** Requires .NET agent version 9.9.0 or higher. For version 10.2.0 or higher, code-level metrics are enabled by default. For versions 9.9.0 through 10.1.0, code-level metrics must be manually [enabled in the .NET agent configuration](/docs/apm/agents/net-agent/configuration/net-agent-configuration#code_level_metrics). If you're using Visual Studio, make sure that you have CodeLenses enabled in by going to **Tools > Options > Text Editor > All Languages > CodeLens** and making sure that both "Enable CodeLens" and "Show CodeStream Code-Level Metrics" are checked. If you're using VS Code, you must have the [C#](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp) extension installed.
* **Node.js:** Requires Node.js agent version 9.7.5 or higher. Code-level metrics must also be [enabled in the Node.js agent configuration](/docs/apm/agents/nodejs-agent/installation-configuration/nodejs-agent-configuration/#code-level-metrics).
* **PHP:** Requires PHP agent version 10.4.0 or higher. For version 10.6.0 or higher, code-level metrics are enabled by default. For versions 10.4.0 through 10.5.0, code-level metrics must be manually [enabled in the PHP agent configuration](/docs/apm/agents/php-agent/configuration/php-agent-configuration/#inivar-code-level-metrics).
* **Python:** Requires Python agent version 7.10.0.175 or higher. Code-level metrics are only available for projects implemented with a [supported Python framework](/docs/apm/agents/python-agent/getting-started/instrumented-python-packages) and for PHP version 7.0 or higher. If you're using VS Code, you must also have the [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) extension installed with the language server enabled.
* **Ruby:** Requires Ruby agent version 8.10.0 or higher. Code-level metrics are only available for Rails applications and Ruby methods with manual traces ([learn more about Ruby methods and CodeStream](/docs/apm/agents/ruby-agent/features/ruby-codestream-integration)). If you're using VS Code, you must also have either the [Ruby](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rebornix.Ruby) or [Ruby Solargraph](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=castwide.solargraph) extension installed with the language server enabled.

You can turn CodeLenses off by going to the CodeStream section of your IDE's settings and unchecking the **CodeStream: Show Golden Signals In Editor** setting.

## Investigating errors [#investigating-errors]

CodeStream will show you recent errors happening in the code you have open in your IDE, but you can see a more comprehensive list of <InlinePopover type="apm" /> errors via the [errors inbox](/docs/errors-inbox/errors-inbox/) on New Relic. When you're ready to dig into the root cause of a specific error with a stack trace, click **Open in IDE** to go directly to the code in your IDE.

<img
  title="A stack trace error in errors inbox with the &quot;Open in IDE button"
  alt="A screenshot of a stack trace error in errors inbox with the &quot;Open in IDE button.&quot;"
  src={errorsinboxOpeninIdeCodestream}
/>

### Collaborate on resolution [#collaborate]

A typical collaboration session could include developers commenting on code in their IDEs, a DevOps engineer assigning errors in errors inbox, and a development manager following along in Slack. By meeting people in the tools they're already using, CodeStream shortens the amount of time between error
discovery and error resolution. 

Watch this short YouTube video (approx. 2:27 minutes) to see this in action.

<Video
  id="LfH7p76Cvro"
  type="youtube"
/>

Whether you clicked on an error in the **Observability section** or clicked **Open in IDE** from the errors inbox on New Relic, CodeStream presents all of the error's details, including the stack trace.

<img
  title="Someone commenting on a line of code associated with an error."
  alt="An animated image that shows someone commenting on a line of code associated with an error."
  src={codestreamObservabilityStackTraceError}
/>

Click any frame in the stack trace to jump straight to the corresponding file and line number in your IDE. Note that frames of the stack trace that represent code that isn't part of your repository (e.g., an external library) aren't clickable.

As you navigate the stack trace, if you come across code that seems like the source of your problem, select it and click the comment icon to start a discussion. CodeStream automatically mentions the most recent person to touch that code, making it easy for you to bring the right people into the discussion.

<img
  title="A comment with the most recent code contributor automatically mentioned."
  alt="A screenshot of a comment with the most recent code contributor automatically mentioned."
  src={codestreamErrorAutoMention}
/>

<figcaption>
  Select code in your editor to add a comment.
</figcaption>

Once you've identified the problem you can assign the error, or update the error status from `unresolved` to `resolved` or `ignored`.

### Associate build SHAs or release tags with errors [#buildsha]

When viewing and error in CodeStream you may see this warning if there's no git reference, either a build SHA or release tag, associated with the error.
CodeStream uses the git reference to match the specific stack trace error with the version of the code running in the environment that triggered the error.

While you don't need a git reference configured to investigate the error, bear in mind that you may not be looking at the version of the code that caused it.

<img
  title="The git reference not configured warning message."
  alt="A screenshot of the git reference not configured warning message."
  src={codestreamBuildShaNotConfigured}
/>

<figcaption>
  The git reference not configured warning message reads: Associate a build SHA or release tag with your errors so that CodeStream can help make sure you're looking at the right version of the code.
</figcaption>

You can use an environment variable to let the New Relic <InlinePopover type="apm" /> agent know the [commit sha](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Revision-Selection) associated with each build of your project. You can also use the [release tag](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging) associated with the
running version of your software.

For New Relic APM, the commit sha and/or release tag (`tags.commit` and `tags.releaseTag`) are added as attributes on `Transaction` and `TransactionError` events. You can use APM environment variables to set these attributes.

We recommend setting one or both of these variables as part of your build pipeline.

* `NEW_RELIC_METADATA_COMMIT` - The commit sha. You can include the whole thing or only the first seven characters (e.g., `734713b`).
* `NEW_RELIC_METADATA_RELEASE_TAG` - A release tag (such as `v0.1.209` or `release-209`). This has the advantage of being human readable.

For more on how to set these variables, here are specific configuration details for each language:

* [Go](/docs/agents/go-agent/configuration/go-agent-configuration/)
* [Java](/docs/agents/java-agent/configuration/java-agent-configuration-config-file/)
* [.NET](/docs/agents/net-agent/configuration/net-agent-configuration/)
* [Node.js](/docs/agents/nodejs-agent/installation-configuration/nodejs-agent-configuration/)
* [PHP](/docs/agents/php-agent/configuration/php-agent-configuration/)
* [Python](/docs/agents/python-agent/configuration/python-agent-configuration/)

If you do have git references configured, CodeStream will let you know if the version of the code you're on locally doesn't contain the reference associated with the error. In this case, you may want to check out the version of the code that does contain that reference so that you can more effectively investigate and resolve the error.

<img
  title="The git reference not found warning message."
  alt="A screenshot of the git reference not found warning message."
  src={codestreamBuildShaNotFound}
/>

<figcaption>
  The git reference not found warning message reads: Your version of the code doesn't match the environment that triggered the error. Fetch the following reference to better investigate the error.
</figcaption>

CodeStream will also let you know if the error doesn't have a stack trace associated with it. This happens with older errors when the stack trace has aged out on New Relic.
